A link like this: 

https://youtu.be/jNQXAC9IVRw

Will be converted to HTML like this:

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jNQXAC9IVRw?rel=0&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;autohide=1&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

</code>
    </pre>

<p>You can also paste third-party embed code as raw HTML directly into Markdown files.</p>

<h2>Twitter</h2>
<p>Links to tweets are rendered via Twitter's own <a rel="nofollow" href="https://publish.twitter.com/">widget generator</a>. Links to lists, profiles, hashtags and other pages are not embedded automatically.</p>

<h2>Youtube</h2>
<p>Links to YouTube videos are rendered through a privacy-enhanced URL. While visitors stay on your site, YouTube does not sign them in. Some personalized features such as Watch later, Share, and Save to playlist are not available in the embedded player, and watched videos are not added to a user’s YouTube history.</p>

<h2>Vimeo</h2>
<p>Links to Vimeo videos are rendered via the standard Vimeo embedded player.</p>

<h2>Bandcamp</h2>
<p>Links to Bandcamp tracks and albums are rendered via the standard Bandcamp embedded player. Audio does not auto-play.</p>

<h2>Embed an image in a post</h2>

<p>An image in your site’s folder becomes its own post by default. To prevent this, prefix the filename with an underscore. Then use <a href="/how/files/markdown">Markdown</a> to embed the image in a text file:</p>

<pre class="text with-chrome" title="Post.txt"><code>Here is how to embed an image from your folder. The image name starts with an underscore so it is not published as its own post:

![Image title](/path/to/the/_image.jpg)

Absolute paths are resolved with your site’s folder as root. Relative paths are resolved from the location of this file. You can also embed an image that’s already on the internet:

![Image title](https://url.of/the/image.jpg)
</code></pre>
