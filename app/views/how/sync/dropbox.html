<h1>Dropbox</h1>

<p>
  You can connect your site's folder to Blot with
  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, a file hosting service
  available on most platforms. You can switch your site to another
  sync method at any point.
</p>

<h2>Can Blot access all the files in my Dropbox?</h2>

<p>
  No, Blot only requests access to your site’s folder in your Dropbox by
  default. You can also choose to grant Blot
  <a href="/how/sync/dropbox">special access to your entire Dropbox</a>. Only
  do this if you want to move your site’s folder, or share it with other
  people who use Dropbox.
</p>

<h2>Bandwidth limits</h2>

<p>
  Dropbox’s
  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/security/banned-links#traffic"
    >traffic limits</a
  >
  do not apply because Blot hosts the contents of your folder on its own server.
</p>

<h2>File size limit</h2>

<p>Blot can sync individual files up to 100 MB from Dropbox. Larger files are not synced.</p>

  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ulysses.app/">Ulysses</a>.
</p>

<h2>Multiple sites</h2>

  Blot moves the existing site folder into a subfolder of the Dropbox App
  folder, then creates a second subfolder for the new site.
</p>

<h2>Switching sync method</h2>

<p>You can switch from Dropbox to another sync method at any time:</p>
