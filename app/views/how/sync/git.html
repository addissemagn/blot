<h1>Git</h1>

<p>
  You can connect your site's folder to Blot with
  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, a version-control
  system for tracking file changes and collaborating with others. You can switch your site to another
  sync method at any time.
</p>

<h2>Setting up Git</h2>

<p>
  When you configure your site with git on the dashboard, Blot will
  provide a repository URL to clone, plus a username and password.
</p>

<small>
  <pre><code>git clone https://blot.im/url-to-your-repository.git</code></pre>
</small>

<p>
  Your site is generated from the <code>master</code> branch of your repository. To update
  your site, commit your changes and push.
</p>

<h2>Using your phone or tablet</h2>

<p>
  There are a few Git clients for phones and tablets. A common option is
  <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com/">Working Copy</a>.
</p>

<h2>Limits</h2>
<p>
  Pushes are subject to a <strong>1 GB</strong> limit. Pushes and pulls must send and receive data within <strong>3 minutes</strong>
  each way. Downloads are throttled to <strong>10 MB/s</strong> after the first 100 MB of a clone or fetch.
</p>

<h2>Using an existing Git repository</h2>

<p>
  You can use an existing Git repository. Set its remote URL to Blot's repository
  endpoint:
</p>

<small>
  <pre><code>git remote set-url origin https://blot.im/url-to-yours.git</code></pre>
</small>

<p>The next time you push, you will need to use the force flag:</p>

<small>
  <pre><code>git push --force</code></pre>
</small>

<h2>Sharing your folder on GitHub</h2>

<p>
  Git supports multiple remote URLs. This means you can use the same repository
  on Blot and GitHub. If you already use GitHub, you can add
  Blot's endpoint:
</p>

<small>
  <pre><code>git remote set-url --add --push origin https://blot.im/your-repo.git</code></pre>
</small>

<p>
  If you already use Blot as your remote, you can add GitHub's endpoint:
</p>

<small>
  <pre><code>git remote set-url --add --push origin https://github.com/your-repo.git</code></pre>
</small>

<p>
  The next time you push, use the force flag so the changes are accepted by both Blot and GitHub:
</p>

<small>
  <pre><code>git push --force</code></pre>
</small>
